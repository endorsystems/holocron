Script(s) to install Arch Linux from ISO

TODO:
- Create a Custom ISO with scripts installed for offline use
-- Add Ansible to the ISO to help with post config

## Post Config
Ansible based. Requires: ansible-galaxy install kewlfft.aur

## Credits
I believe credit where credit is due, it also helps other people understand whats in there. Here are the sources for my thought process on this.
- A complete install script, sourced some ideas and thoughts from this.
